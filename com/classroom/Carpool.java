//		Create integers named [cars], [drivers], [passengers], [cars_not_driven], and [cars_driven].
//		Create doubles named [space_in_a_car], [carpool_capacity], and [average_passengers_per_car].
//		Create doubles named [average_miles_driven], [average_miles_per_gallon], [gas_cost_per_gallon], and [money_saved].
//		Create double named [gas_cost_per_trip]
//
//		[cars_not_driven] should be equal to the difference between [cars] and [drivers]
//		[cars_driven] should be equal to the value of [drivers]
//		[carpool_capacity] should be equal to the product of [cars_driven] and [space_in_a_car]
//		[average_passengers_per_car] should be equal to the ratio of [passengers] to [cars_driven]
//		[gas_cost_per_trip] should be equal to ([average_miles_driven] * [gas_cost_per_gallon])/[average_miles_per_gallon]
//		[money_saved] should be equal to the difference between ([gas_cost_per_trip] * [cars]) and ([gas_cost_per_trip] * [cars_driven])
//
//		For the other variables, use the following values:
//		[cars] = 100
//		[space_in_a_car] = 4.0
//		[drivers] = 30
//		[passengers] = 90
//		[average_miles_driven] = 29.2
//		[average_miles_per_gallon] = 23.6
//		[gas_cost_per_gallon] = 2.517
//
//		Print out the following lines to show off your calculations to the world!
//		To clarify, anything in brackets means it's a variable!
//		So [cars] is the variable you named cars.
//
//		//Output
//		There are [cars] cars available.
//		There are only [drivers] drivers available.
//		That means there will be [cars_not_driven] empty cars today!
//		We can transport [carpool_capacity] people today.
//		Out of that, we're transporting [passengers] today.
//		So we'll need to put about [average_passengers_per_car] in each car.
//		Long story short, today, we'll be saving about $[money_saved]!
